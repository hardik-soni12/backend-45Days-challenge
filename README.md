# 🚀 45 Days Backend Developer Challenge (2025)

This repository documents my **45-day journey** to become proficient in Backend Development with **Python, Flask, MySQL, SQLAlchemy ORM, REST APIs, and AI integration**.  
I’m dedicating **4 hours daily** to this challenge, with the goal of becoming **job-ready for backend internships/fresher roles in 2025–26**.

## 📌 Timeline & Goals
- **Day 1–3** → Python Revision (Core, OOP, Error Handling, Modules)  
- **Day 4–10** → Flask REST APIs + MySQL + SQLAlchemy ORM (CRUD + Relationships + Migrations)  
- **Day 11–25** → Docker + Deployment + Redis Basics (caching, sessions)  
- **Day 26–40** → AI Integration (OpenAI API + awareness of Vector DBs like pgvector)  
- **Day 41–45** → Revision + Interview Prep (DSA basics, backend Q&A, mock interviews)
